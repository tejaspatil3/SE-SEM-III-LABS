**SE SEM-III Computer Engineering SPPU 2019 Pattern**
This repository contains laboratory resources, source codes, and assignment documents for Semester 3 of the Second Year (SE) Computer Engineering course at Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU), following the 2019 Pattern.

Repository Overview
The content covers practical assignments for Semester 3, specifically focusing on Data Structures Laboratory (DSL) and Object Oriented Programming & Computer Graphics Laboratory (OOP & CGL).

Directory Structure
**1. SE (DSL) LAB (Data Structures Laboratory)**
This directory contains implementations of fundamental data structures using C++ and Python.

cpp-Codes:

Advanced Tree Data Structures: Binary Search Trees (BST), AVL Trees, Threaded Binary Trees.

Hashing implementations: Dictionary and Telephone Book applications.

Graph Algorithms: Flight paths and sequence probability.

File Handling: Employee and Student index-sequential files.

Heap Data Structure: Student marks analysis.

DSAL-py-cpp:

Python scripts for Set operations, String manipulation, Matrix operations, and Sorting/Searching algorithms.

C++ implementations for Assignments 7 through 13.

DSAL-TXT-Practical:

Input and output text files used for testing the assignments.

Resources:

DSL Lab Manual (PDF).

**2. SE (OOP & CG) LAB (Object Oriented Programming & Computer Graphics)**
This section covers C++ programming for object-oriented concepts and graphics rendering algorithms.

A. CGL (Computer Graphics Lab)
CGL CODES & OUTPUT:

Source Codes: Implementations of drawing algorithms including DDA, Polygon Filling, Hilbert Curve, Koch Curve, Robot Arm simulation, and Geometric Transformations (Sunrise, Triangle).

CG OUT: Contains visual output files, including MP4 videos of animations and PNG screenshots of rendered graphics.

Mini Project: Source code for the Computer Graphics mini-project.

B. OOPS (Object Oriented Programming Lab)
Assignments:

Source codes for Assignments 1 through 7 (OOPLASS01.cpp to OOPLASS07.cpp).

Covers concepts such as Classes, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Exception Handling, and File I/O.

Resources:

OOPCGL Lab Manual (PDF).

Prerequisites and Tools
To execute the codes in this repository, the following are required:

C++ Compiler (G++/GCC): For DSL and OOP assignments.

Python Interpreter: For DSL Python assignments.

Graphics Libraries: graphics.h or equivalent libraries compatible with your C++ compiler (e.g., TurboC++ or libgraph on Linux) for running Computer Graphics assignments.

Video Player: To view the .mp4 output files.

Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.

For DSL: Navigate to cpp-Codes or DSAL-py-cpp to compile and run the data structure algorithms.

For CGL: Ensure your environment is set up to support graphics libraries before compiling the source files in CGL CODES & OUTPUT.

For OOP: Compile the files in the OOPS folder using a standard C++ compiler.

Disclaimer
These codes and documents are provided for educational and reference purposes to assist with understanding the SPPU 2019 Pattern syllabus. Students are encouraged to implement and test the logic independently.
